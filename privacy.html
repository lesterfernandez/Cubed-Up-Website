            Your privacy is yours. Upon opening the app the only information recorded is 
            statistical information which serves to dictate how many people use the app. 
            No personal information which is directly tied to your identity is recorded unless absolutely necessary. 
            For example when creating an account your email and password is 
            stored securely online but no additional unncessary information will be recorded.
            <br><br><br>
            Cubed Up, Lester Fernandez and Useful Tech will never sell user information.
